He that Writes either a True or False History, ought immediately to take Notice of the Time
and Sense where those Accidents happen'd, that the Reader may not remain long in Suspence;
he ought also in few Words describe the Person who bears the most Considerable Part in his
Story to engage the Reader; 'tis a Thing that little conduces to the raising the Merit of a
Heroe, to Praise him by the Beauty of his Face; this is mean and trivial, Detail discourages
Persons of good Taste; 'tis the Qualities of the Soul which ought to render him acceptable;
and there are those Qualities likewise that ought to be discourag'd in the Principal Character
of a Heroe, for there are Actors of a Second Rank, who serve only to bind the Intrigue, and
they ought not to be compar'd with those of the First Order, nor be given Qualities that may
cause them to be equally Esteemd; 'tis not by Extravagant Expressions, nor Repeated Praises,
that the Reader's Esteem is acquired to the Character of the Heroe's, their Actions ought to
plead far them; 'tis by that they are made known; and describe themselves; altho' they ought
to have some Extraordinary Qualities, they ought not all to have 'em in an equal degree; 'tis
impossible they shou'd not have some Imperfections, seeing they are Men, but their Imperfections
ought not to destroy the Character that is attributed to them; if we describe them Brave, Liberal
and Generous, we ought not to attribute to them Baseness or Cowardice, because that their Actions
wou'd otherwise bely their Character, and the Predominant Virtures of the Heroes: 'Tis no Argument
that Salust, though so Happy in the Description of Men, in the Description of Cataline does
not in some manner describe him Covetous also; for he says this Ambitious Man spent his own
Means profusely, and raged after the Goods of another with an Extream Greediness, but these
Two Motions which seem contrary were inspired by the same Wit; these were the Effects of the
Unbounded Ambition of Cataline, and the desire he had to Rise by the help of his Creatures
on the Ruins of the Roman Republic; so vast a Project cou'd not be Executed by very great Sums
of Money, which obliged Cataline to make all Sorts of Efforts to get it from all Parts.

Every Historian ought to be extreamly uninterested; he ought neither to Praise nor Blame those
he speaks of; he ought to be contented with Exposing the Actions, leaving an entire Liberty
to the Reader to judge at he pleases, without taking any care not to blame his Heroes, or make
their Apology; he is no judge of the merit of his Heroes, his Business is to represent them
in the same Form as they are, and describe their Sentiments, Manners and Conduct; it deviates
in some manner from his Character, and that perfect uninterestedness, when he adds to the Names
of those he introduces Epithets either to Blame or Praise them; there are but few Historians
who exactly follow this Rule, and who maintain this Difference, from which they cannot deviate
without rendring themselves guilty of Partiality.
