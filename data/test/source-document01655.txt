THE STRAND DISTRICT

PART I

WEST AND NORTH OF CHARING CROSS

Beginning at the extreme westerly limit of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, on the south side of
Hyde Park Corner, we find ourselves in the Green Park. This is a triangular piece of ground,
which was formerly called Little or Upper St. James's Park. It has not much history. In 1642
fortifications were erected on Constitution Hill, and at the end of the seventeenth century
this same spot was a noted place for duels. Fireworks on a great scale, with public entertainments,
took place in the park at the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, and again in 1814. On Constitution
Hill three attempts were made on the life of Queen Victoria. The chief object of interest in
the park is Buckingham Palace, which is not altogether in St. Martin's; in fact, the greater
part, including most of the grounds, is in the adjacent parish of St. George's, Hanover Square.
The palace is a dreary building, without any pretence of architectural merit, but it attracts
attention as the London home of the English Sovereign.

It stands on the site of Arlington House, so called from its connection with Henry Bennet,
Earl of Arlington (the Earl whose initial supplied one of the a's in the word "Cabal"). John
Sheffield, Duke of Buckingham, bought the house and rebuilt it in 1703, naming it after himself,
and including in the grounds part of the land belonging to Tart Hall, which stood at the head
of St. James's Street, and has been mentioned in the account of the adjoining parish of St.
Margaret's, Westminster. Buckingham House was bought from Sir Charles Sheffield, son of the
above-mentioned Duke, by the Crown in 1762. In 1775 it was granted to Queen Charlotte as a
place of residence in lieu of Somerset House, and at this period it was known as Queen's House.
George IV. employed Nash to renovate the building, and the restoration was so complete as to
amount to an entire rebuilding, in the style considered then fashionable; the result is the
present dreary building with stuccoed frontage. The interior is handsome enough, and, like
that of many a London house of less importance, is considerably more cheerful than the exterior.
The chief staircase is of white marble, and the rooms are richly decorated. The state apartments
include drawing-rooms, saloons, and the throne-room, which is sixty-four feet in length. The
picture-gallery contains a collection of pictures made by George IV., chiefly of the Dutch
school; it includes works of Rembrandt, Rubens, Vandyck, Dürer, Cuyp, Ruysdael, Vandervelde,
and others.

The grounds are about forty acres in extent, and contain a large piece of ornamental water,
on the shore of which is a pavilion, or summer-house, with frescoes by Eastlake, Maclise, Landseer,
Dyce, and others, illustrating Milton's "Comus." The channel of the Tyburn, now a sewer, passes
under the palace. The Marble Arch, at the north-east corner of Hyde Park, was first designed
to face the palace, where it stood until 1850.
