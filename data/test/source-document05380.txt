Miss DOROTHEA CONYERS has long ere this established herself as a specialist of repute in Irish
sporting tales. You will need but one look at the picture wrapper of The Financing of Fiona
(ALLEN) to see that a repetition of the same agreeable mixture awaits you within. Fiona was
a charming young woman (Irish, of course) with a rich uncle and a poor, very unattractive cousin,
who loved her for her expectations. As Fiona had no conception about money beyond the spending
of it, the uncle made a will, whose object was that she should have plenty. The suitor, however,
knowing of this, and being a naughty, rather improbable person, destroyed part of it, with
the result that Fiona was apparently left only the ancestral home and no cash to keep it up.
So she was forced to take in gentleman boarders for the hunting, and (for propriety's sake)
to invent a mythical chaperon, who lived above stairs. And, after all, she needn't have done
any such thing, because the rich uncle, in leaving her all the contents of the mansion, had
foolishly forgotten to mention a secret drawer full of Canadian securities. As for the villain,
I really hardly dare tell you the impossibly silly way in which he allowed himself to be caught
out. But of course all this melodrama is not what matters. The important thing about Miss CONYERS'
people is that (whatever their private worries) a-hunting they will go; and Fiona, financed
by her paying guests, shows in this respect as capital sport as any of her predecessors. For
the rest, I can hardly say with honesty that the story is equal to its author's best form.

What I like particularly about Mr. FREDERICK NIVEN is the friendly way in which he contrives
to make his readers and himself into a family party. "We must," he writes at the beginning
of a chapter in Cinderella of Skookum Greek (NASH), "get a move on with the story, in case
you become more tired of Archer's compound fracture than he was himself." This is by no means
the only occasion on which he shows his thoughtfulness for us, and I think it very kind and
nice of him. At the same time I will ungraciously admit that the weak point of his story is
that it does not move quite fast enough. Admirable artist in psychology and atmosphere, his
plot, if you can call it a plot, is very slight. Cyrus Archer, the young American of the compound
fracture (who had my sympathy from the start because he could never remember dates), goes out
into the back of beyond for a spell before settling down to married life and a place in his
father's business, and at Skookum Creek, where he grows tomatoes and studies Indians, he meets
his Cinderella, with the result that his life has to be completely rearranged. A commonplace
tale, but there is a rare and distinct flavour about the telling of it. Mr. NIVEN'S manner
has indeed a very particular charm, over which one would take an even keener pleasure in lingering
if only he himself lingered a little less over his story.
