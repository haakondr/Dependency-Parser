As soon as we returned to Chelsea, the "Connexion of the Physical Sciences" was published.
It was dedicated to Queen Adelaide, who thanked me for it at a drawing-room. Some time after
Somerville and I went to Scotland; we had travelled all night in the mail coach, and when it
became light, a gentleman who was in the carriage said to Somerville, "Is not the lady opposite
to me Mrs. Somerville, whose bust I saw at Chantrey's?" The gentleman was Mr. Sopwith, of Newcastle-on-Tyne,
a civil and mining engineer. He was distinguished for scientific knowledge, and had been in
London to give information to a parliamentary committee. He travelled faster than we did, and
when we arrived at Newcastle he was waiting to take us to his house, where we were hospitably
received by Mrs. Sopwith. His conversation was highly interesting, and to him I was indebted
for much information on mining generally, and on the mineral wealth of Great Britain, while
writing on Physical Geography. Many years after he and Mrs. Sopwith came and saw me at Naples,
which gave me much pleasure. He was unlike any other traveller I ever met with, so profound
and original were his observations on all he saw.

On coming home I found that I had made an error in the first edition of the "Physical Sciences,"
in giving 365 days 6 hours as the length of the civil year of the ancient Egyptians. My friend
Mr. Hallam, the historian, wrote to me, proving from history and epochs of the chronology of
the ancient Egyptians, that their civil year was only 365 days. I was grateful to that great
and amiable man for copies of all his works while he was alive, and I am obliged to his daughter
for an excellent likeness of him, now that he is no more.

    FROM HENRY HALLAM, ESQ., TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.

    WIMPOLE STREET, March 12th, 1835.

    MY DEAR MADAM,

    As you will probably soon be called upon for another edition of your
    excellent work on the "Connexion of the Physical Sciences," I think
    you will excuse the liberty I take in mentioning to you one passage
    which seems to have escaped your attention in so arduous a labour.
    It is in page 104, where you have this sentence:--

    "The Egyptians estimated the year at 365 d. 6 h., by which they lost
    one year in every 14,601, their Sothiac period. They determined the
    length of their year by the heliacal rising of Sirius, 2782 years
    before the Christian era, which is the earliest epoch of Egyptian
    chronology."

    The Egyptian civil year was of 365 days only, as we find in
    Herodotus, and I apprehend there is no dispute about it. The Sothiac
    period, or that cycle in which the heliacal rising of Sirius passed
    the whole civil year, and took place again on the same day, was of
    1461 years, not 14,601. If they had adopted a year of 365 d. 6 h.,
    this period would have been more than three times 14,601; the excess
    of the sidereal year above that being only 9' 9", which will not
    amount to a day in less than about 125 years.
