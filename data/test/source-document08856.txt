Essen is not on the most direct route to Goch where one crosses the German border into Holland,
and in consequence I arrived in Goch via Essen much too late to catch the last train from there
to Flushing. Since boats leave Flushing only once a day, early in the morning, I had to lose
one whole day and was compelled to remain another night on German soil.

I do not pretend to offer any explanation for these strange happenings. I was followed constantly
thereafter, as previously, the men being cleverly changed at every opportunity. My every step
was dogged. At Wesel a detective sat at the same table in the station restaurant while I ate
dinner. Such being the case I was, to say the least, a bit annoyed.

At Essen during a fifteen-minute wait for a change of trains, I withdrew to one end of the
platform after having rechecked the two big mail-sacks. I was standing alone, with a detective,
as usual, off in the background, when a man who looked a typical raw-boned Englishman drew
near and hung around, staring at me. I looked him up and down and then turned my back thinking,
"Another detective!" It was impossible to believe that an Englishman could be, of all places,
in Essen. He finally approached me, saying in English of a most perfect and pronounced British
accent, "Are you an American?" I replied, "Yes, are you a police officer? If so, please show
me your card." He replied, "No, I am in a delicate position. I am trying to go to England this
evening. I have American papers. You must see me through. I am ----." I cut him short by saying
that I regretted, etc., and deliberately walked away. From that time on this man dogged me
everywhere, trying to pass through gates with me and to get into the same compartments, even
following me to the same hotels and restaurants, and trying to make anything he could out of
my presence. I never lost sight of him for long until we finally set foot in England, where
he did finally arrive, in spite of some very close shaves. I last saw him giving me a very
ugly look as I landed at Folkestone. Whatever his nationality, he certainly was a spy in the
German service.

An uneventful journey of some four hours across Holland brought me to Vlissingen, as the Dutch
call Flushing, and there I spent the afternoon, wandering about in boredom, trying to pass
away the slow hours until the boat arrived and I could climb into my berth.

London, Saturday, December 12th. We had an exciting trip across the North Sea, taking zigzag
courses to avoid mine-fields and sighting numerous destroyers and one sunken ship. We successfully
avoided either hitting a mine or running into a torpedo. The boat was packed down with Belgian
and French refugees. One Luxembourger had been a whole month getting to Flushing from his home
in Belgium. I was much relieved when I arrived at Victoria Station with my pouch and found
a clerk from the Embassy waiting for me, and still more relieved when we had deposited all
the bags safely at their destination.
