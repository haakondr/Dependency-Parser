The problem of the course of the Niger was reserved for Richard Lander, who in 1830, sailed
down the Niger from Baossa, and reached the Atlantic by the river Nun, one of its branches.

Other travellers, more highly accomplished, but less fortunate, had in the meantime explored
the countries to the east and north of the Mediterranean. Of these, Burckhardt, a German, was
among the most distinguished. After preparing himself for the most complete adoption of Mahometan
life by a sojourn of two years at Aleppo, and even risking the pilgrimage to Mecca, he was
on the point of travelling to Fezzan, when he died of a country fever. His works throw much
light on the habits and literature of Syria and Palestine. The narratives of Hamilton, Leigh,
Belzoni, and of Salt the consul in Egypt, largely increased the public interest in countries,
universally known to have been the birth-places of religion, science, and literature; and Lane
and Wilkinson have admirably availed themselves of those discoveries, and added important information
of their own.

The old connexion of trade with China naturally suggested a wish for more direct intercourse
with that mysterious region, and in 1792, an embassy conducted by Lord Macartney was sent to
Pekin. The narrative of the embassy, by Sir George Staunton, contributed largely to our knowledge
of the interior. But the late Chinese war, and the freedom of our commerce, will probably open
up all the secrets of this most jealous of empires.

The geographical discoveries of this embassy were of more value than its diplomatic services.
The coast of Corea was found to be bordered by a vast and fertile Archipelago. The sea is actually
studded with islands; and the narratives of Macleod, and Captain Basil Hall, the latter one
of the liveliest narrators of his time, gave the impression, that they contained scenes of
singular beauty.

On the cessation of the war in 1815, the British Admiralty directed their leisure to the promotion
of science; and the exploration of the northern coasts of America was commenced in a series
of expeditions under the command of Parry, Ross, Back, Franklin, and other enterprising officers.
Their narratives gave us new islands and bays, but the great problem of the north-west passage
continues unsolved.

It has been alleged, that such expeditions are useless. But it must be remembered, that true
philosophy disdains no advance of knowledge as useless; that, however difficult, or even to
our present means impassable, the route may be, no man can decide on the means of posterity;
that we may yet find facilities as powerful for passing the ice and the ocean, as the railroad
for traversing the land; and that the evident design of Providence in placing difficulties
before man is, to sharpen his faculties for their mastery. We have already explored the whole
northern coast, to within about two hundred miles from Behring's Straits, and an expedition
is at present on foot which will probably complete the outline of the American continent towards
the Pole.
