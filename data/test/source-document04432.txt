It must be premised, that the session 1851 was considered by politicians a peculiarly barren
and unfruitful one, as the Great Exhibition, in conjunction with ministerial difficulties,
and the monster debates on the Ecclesiastical Titles' Bill, tended greatly to impede the ordinary
business of the Houses, and gave an air of tedium and languor to the whole proceedings. Nevertheless,
the papers for the year amount to no less than sixty volumes! Of these, the first six contain
Public Bills. A bill, as most of our readers must be aware, is a measure submitted to the consideration
of parliament with the view of its being adopted into the legal code of the country, for which
it must receive the sanction of both Houses and the assent of the crown. When a bill has 'passed'
through the Lords and Commons, and received the royal assent, it becomes an 'act'--that is,
a law. A bill, in passing through the Houses, is subjected to numerous amendments and alterations
in form, and is often printed, for the use of members and other parties interested, three or
four times after such alterations, before it comes forth in its final and permanent form as
an act. Thus, the famous Ecclesiastical Titles' Bill is to be found in three several shapes
among the bills before it reappears for the fourth time as an act. Again, the word 'public'
prefixed to these six volumes of bills, reminds us of the vast amount of business that comes
before parliament and its committees in the shape of 'private' bills, of which no record appears
here. These are bills of special and individual application, such as when a public company
seeks an act of incorporation, the possessor of an entailed estate desires to sell a portion
of ground, a railway directory asks for powers of various kinds, and so on.

An examination of the contents of these six volumes would shew how many and diverse are the
subjects that turn up in parliament in the course of a single and brief session; but to enter
on it satisfactorily would require a great amount of space, and might, after all, be more tedious
than profitable. A glance at those actually passed may suffice. These were 106 in number: the
first is, 'An Act to amend the Passengers' Act of 1849;' and the hundred and sixth, 'An Act
to appoint Commissioners to inquire into the Existence of Bribery in St Albans.' Besides the
acts of an ordinary or routine character, we find the following among the subjects legislated
on:--The Marine Forces, Leases for Mills in Ireland, Protection of Original Designs, the Protection
of Servants and Apprentices, the Sale of Arsenic, Highways in Wales, Sites for Schools, Herring-Fishery,
Prisons in Scotland, Common Lodging-Houses, Window and House Duties, Marriages in India, Ecclesiastical
Titles, Smithfield Market, Settlement of the Boundaries of Canada and New Brunswick, Highland
Roads and Bridges, Gunpowder Magazine at Liverpool, Management of the Insane in India, Lands
in New Zealand, Representative Peers of Scotland, Emigration, Law of Evidence, Criminal Justice,
&c.
