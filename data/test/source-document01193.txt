Daring enough in themselves, those German visitations seemed insignificant by  comparison 
with  the  raids  which  were  being  carried  out  almost simultaneously on the other  side
of the sea by our  own naval airmen. For while the German aeroplanist was helping to dig a
cabbage garden at Dover, one of  our Squadron-Commanders--R.B. Davies, R.N.--from  a Maurice-Farman
biplane  was  much more  profitably  engaged  in  dropping a  dozen  bombs on  a  Zeppelin
shed  at  Brussels--causing  "clouds  of smoke"  to  arise therefrom--most probably from the
flames of the incendiarised air-ship. The  attack started from a  point in the vicinity of
Heligoland, and the air-craft were escorted by a light-cruiser and destroyer force, together
with submarines. The enemy put up a fight by means  of two  Zeppelins,  three  or  four  bomb-dropping
sea-planes,  and several submarines.  Six out  of the  seven pilots  returned safely--three
were  re-embarked by  our  ships,  and three  were  picked  up by  British submarines.  Flight-Commander
Francis  E.T.  Hewlett,  R.N., was  reported missing. Both at Yarmouth and Scarborough the
German  bombarding cruisers were so nervously afraid of  being caught in the  act that they
may almost be said  to have only fired their guns and then run  away again. But our triple
flotilla at the mouth of the Elbe spent a deliberate three hours in the performance of its
task,  and then  calmly withdrew  with only one  of the  daring pilots missing. So far,  it
was the most  thrilling episode of the  war, and must give our enemies "furiously to think,"
in addition to furnishing them with much more  for the  nourishment of  their hate.  Of this
insensate hatred against us  in the hearts  of the German  people--and all because  we have
"queered their  pitch," or  crossed their  long-cherished schemes  for the destruction of 
our Empire--the  most furious  exponent is  the Kölnische Zeitung,  or  Cologne  Gazette, 
as we  generally  call  it--which  may be  described, on  the  whole,  as the  most  authoritative
organ of  the Fatherland--or the Times  of Germany, but always with  a difference. The curious
anomaly is that the seat of this powerful journal should be so far away  from  the capital--at
Cologne.  There  is  an old  story--known  to tourists who read  their guide-books--about the
"Three  Kings of Cologne," but now  this story has just  received a pendant which  gives anything
but satisfaction at Cologne itself or anywhere else in Germany. Ingenious French engineers,
for example, have constructed warm shower-baths, hair-dressing  saloons, and similar conveniences,
while the British "Eye-Witness"  was able to write  recently of our own  lines: "The trenches
themselves  are heated  by braziers and  stoves and  floored with straw, bricks and  boards.
Behind them are shelters and  dug-outs of every description most  ingeniously contrived." The
above  French cartoon, which is  from "La  Vie Parisienne,"  is  headed "La  Guerre des  Taubes
et  des Taupes" (moles).
